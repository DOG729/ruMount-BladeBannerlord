    <string id="03hsUIsL" text="Vlandian knights who train for war for almost every day of their lives, they are truly are a force to be reckoned with. When they appear on the battlefield they strike fear into their enemies. When they start their charge, even the ground trembles under their heavy thundering hooves." />
    <string id="0dnD9cR4" text="Gone is the dominance of the legionary. These days, when one thinks of imperial shock troops, one pictures the famed cataphracts, armored from head to toe in the best steel the Empire's forges can forge. Maintained as full-time soldiers at the palace's expense, these professional cavaliers have nothing else to do but train with lances, composite recurve bows, swords and axes." />
    <string id="1E5axt0j" text="The Battanian clans have a lively tradition of their least sociable members going off to the woods to live like animals. Many of those still return to fight alongside their people when they go to war, but not having trained with the kern they often take up the javelin and fight as skirmishers." />
    <string id="1vYsKNdH" text="Warm up will end in {SECONDS_LEFT} seconds" />
    <string id="3In09YKu" text="Every Vlandian village is expected to supply a levy of troops for its feudal lord, and if the quota isn't met the lord will come around and take away some fresh-faced youths at swordpoint. Rarely do the lords waste much time or money giving them equipment or training. But still a crafty peasant will find ways to survive by looting enemies (and comrades) and by staying with more experienced allies." />
    <string id="3r3MPbhV" text="Sturgian boyars are always on the lookout for skilled warriors to bring into their druzhina, or personal retinue. Kept loyal with gifts of gold, equipped with the best weapons and horses, they form the shock force of any northern army." />
    <string id="47mXdgma" text="Game has ended in a draw." />
    <string id="5AzK3hAE" text="Only Flag {PARAM1} is remaining. The other two have been removed from the map." />
    <string id="5FanO0Lb" text="Though most of the Khuzaits have settled in towns and villages since the conquest, a few still live out on the steppe, subject to no authority. They will still fight for the khan, for pay, and are among the confederacy's hardiest riders, though their equipment tends to be cheaper and their armor lighter than the main tribal force." />
    <string id="5WMHiC9P" text="Vlandian warlords discovered that while levying peasents is a necessary evil, they can get the most out of it by giving them crossbows and teaching them how to point and shoot properly with it. Using this machine, which in essence is a handheld version of the feared Calradic ballistae, Vlandian arbelists can punch a hole through even the heaviest of the armor of the day." />
    <string id="6rBs2x2E" text="Preparation stage! Select your equipment!" />
    <string id="7UagK9bw" text="You" />
    <string id="akXybGlj" text="Also known as the 'Kern', the main fighting forces of the Battanian clans are backed up by a general levy of men fit to bear arms. A screaming rush of these troops, wielding long knives, clubs and spears, can be a terrifying sight." />
    <string id="aT2qskIk" text="Literally called the Raiders, these cavalry excel at hit and run tactics. Being excellent riders, they are usually serve as army scouts. On the battlefield, they are positioned on the flanks and are expected to screen friendlies or outflank enemies. Other times, they are ordered to hunt down routers and chase the enemy light cavalry, who are too fast for the cataphracts." />
    <string id="B7XVRNoz" text="The Berzerkers are elite northlander mercenaries that wield great two-handed axes and other fearsome weapons, with simple wolf skins to cover them. These agile warriors are famous for fighting in reckless abandon to serve as shock troops to break the enemy line." />
    <string id="bdrb4ur3" text="Every village and town in the Sturgian lands supplies a force of Voi, or militia, to the boyars and princes. They support the druzhina in battle, and if they distinguish themselves, can hope for promotion into its ranks." />
    <string id="bGCJdPKj" text="Among the peasant levy's biggest, meanest and the quickest are selected and trained to become the feared Voulgiers. These polearm wielding soldiers serve Vlandian armies as shocktroopers and lay waste to enemy infantry." />
    <string id="CwL29FSv" text="Life is harsh in the Nahasa, so a child of the tribe is expected to learn how to fight well. These tribal warriors are cheap but effective troops that can perform different roles with proper equipment selection and hold their own against many of the better armed enemy soldiers." />

    <string id="EH2wycm4" text="({PARAM})" />
    <string id="FeM74rlx" text="A few of the strongest and most loyal youth in each tribe are recruited to join the Kheshig, the private guard forces of the khan and his noyans. These fearless fighters are trained extensively to become deadly in both archery and melee." />
    <string id="FfGKyq5e" text="Every Sturgian community has hunters and trappers who bring back the luxurious furs of the north to be traded for goods from warmer lands. In wartime, they will often enlist as archers, trackers, and scouts." />
    <string id="FoSTFipC" text="{PLAYER_NAME} is now un-muted." />
    <string id="h4Pt3aX9" text="Vlandian sergeants are commoners who found they have a knack for bloodletting. Often they've served time in a mercenary company, or drift from lord to lord. They're famous throughout Calradia for their tenacity and professionalism. They are the anvil part of a Vlandian force's 'Hammer and Anvil,' the hammer of course being the knights." />
    <string id="HdgRTYa7" text="The best warriors among the Battanians pledge themselves to accompany the tribal leader into the battle whenever he leads. They make up the center of the line, and stiffen the spine of the kern." />
    <string id="hhU2vxWe" text="You have been defeated!" />
    <string id="iDzjO25n" text="Many towns and villages who are not formally part of the Khuzait tribal confederation are required to provide troops for the Khan's armies. Called Rabble by others, these generally poorly armed and trained people can hope to hold their own until the Khanate's elite cavalry comes to their relief. " />
    <string id="iHHQi3aA" text="The fiercest non-Khuzait tribes who are subject to the Khan are usually hill peoples. Their fierce spear-charges, often presaged by a hail of javelins, can sweep away a foe that has been disrupted by supporting horse archers." />
    <string id="iPvn6Cdi" text="Landless younger sons of the Battanian nobles frequently join fighting companies, known as Fianna, seeking out adventure wherever they can find it. Many live in the woods and hunt with the famed Battanian longbow, but they can also don armor and fight in tight ranks if necessary." />

    <string id="JhbHd9aW" text="Two flags will be removed in {PARAM1} seconds." />
    <string id="JJOcOByF" text="Aserai guards are selected from the tallest and strongest members of the tribe.

    <string id="leAbyu5E" text="A handful of the wealthier inhabitants on the Sturgian frontiers own their own horses, and many have learned the riding skills of the nearby horse tribes. They are much valued by boyars as scouts and screeners for the main force." />
    <string id="lEHjxPTs" text="Ally" />
    <string id="Lkeorx7u" text="You have {?IS_WINNER}won{?}lost{\?} the round!" />
    <string id="Mpu7rab1" text="The core of the empire's armies are its professional infantry and heavy cataphracts, but today's hard-pressed imperial commanders will usually bring along a sizeable force of volunteer auxiliaries to pad out the numbers. They're expected to stay out of melee, flank the enemy and pelt them with javelins." />
    <string id="Mrd3xhZx" text="The Sturgian frontiers have often attracted fugitives and escaped slaves who prefer to live free beyond the reach of any boyars' authority.

    <string id="mXoD63su" text="The best hunters of the Battanians join their tribal levy as archers. They usually skirmish ahead of the main force, running away from more heavily armed enemy troops." />

    <string id="pgw7LMRo" text="Server over capacity." />
    <string id="Q4zplpf7" text="The very term Mamluke means 'property'. The Aserai nobility want professional soldiers who have no familial ties and nothing else to do but hone their fighting skills, be it riding, lance, bow or the sword.

They are highly sought after as mercenaries or trainers for other arbalists throughout all of Vlandia.

    <string id="RR1uTag6" text="The Battanian heroes of old were known for their ferocity and their disdain for their own safety, and those warriors who hew most closely to this ideal take up the massive falx, a devastating curved blade that is usually used two-handed. They fight in the center of the line, trying to chop their way to the enemy's standard." />
    <string id="siPFYWiq" text="Some tribes live even deeper in the deserts where there is no hope for survival without their loyal mounts because of the vast distances.

    <string id="t7IHdqai" text="With their considerably lighter armor, the Aserai came to rely on their ranged troops a lot. And these skilled archers are the backbone of their armies.

    <string id="tC6vapdE" text="While most Battanian nobles will fight with their oathsworn in the midst of the battle line on foot, a few, including younger and lighter aristocrats, will fight from horseback. They are light rather than heavy cavalry, best used as outriders and flankers." />

But the name didn't stick to the proud soldiers who liked to be called Legionaries instead, in honour of the legions of old." />
