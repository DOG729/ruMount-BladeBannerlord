    <string id="GO47mubj" text="What exactly are you proposing?" />
    <string id="Gp3l5fjI" text="So, about that task I gave you... Well, I can only hope that you gave it your best try, and you'd said you would." />
    <string id="gxV3M6HH" text="Naturally, I wish {?GENDER}her{?}him{\?} a long life and victory over all {?GENDER}her{?}his{\?} foes. To say anything else would be treason, as I'm sure you know." />

    <string id="JJAWbuNT" text="I am {CONVERSATION_CHARACTER.LINK}, of the {CLAN_NAME}. They say our ancestor was among those who came in the golden ships that came to this land from the West, in the Time of the Heroes.

    <string id="JkHvOVlo" text="I shall mark down your name. Now, do not take it amiss if I do not immediately extend my hand in friendship, for the world is a treacherous place, and I have learned to be wary." />
    <string id="JNb6l91E" text="If you ever want a chance for glory, you might want to consider fighting for me. One day you can tell your grandchildren that you served under my command." />
