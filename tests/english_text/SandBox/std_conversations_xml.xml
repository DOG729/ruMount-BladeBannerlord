    <string id="02hGzXBc" text="I'll let you live, if you promise me..." />
    <string id="04H5rVPX" text="I received the gift, presented to me through my {s11} {s10}. Bah! Do you think you can buy my friendship?" />
    <string id="06rWnUbn" text="You must be {PLAYER.LINK}. We have just had the honor of watching you distinguish yourself in the recent tournament{s8}." />
    <string id="08jWg0fA" text="Very well. Hopefully, a little over a month from now, we shall be wed." />
    <string id="09rTab3N" text="I've been expecting you. Here they are, make sure they reach {s4} intact and without delay." />
    <string id="0Ax1puWR" text="Oh {PLAYER.LINK}, how happy that would make me! But my {s11} {s4} would never allow it... Perhaps it is best that we part..." />
    <string id="0diIjGUT" text="Now -- here's my plan. I could bring this to the attention of {s4}, lord of the city, but that would mean an inquiry, my word against the captain's, and witnesses can be bought and evidence destroyed, or maybe the whole thing will be forgotten if the enemy comes across the border again, and all I'll get for my trouble is a knife in the ribs. In time of war, you see, a king's eye wanders far from his domain, and his subjects suffer. So I've got another idea. I've got a small group of townsfolk together, some men in my employ and some others who've lost relatives to these bandits, and we'll storm the captain's home and bring him in chains before {s4}, hopefully with a few captured bandits to explain how things stack up." />
    <string id="0dtueg9S" text="I am thinking of taking {s24} by storm." />
    <string id="0fb02oI3" text="Well that didn't go too well, did it? (Remember, you must press and hold down the right mouse button to keep your block effective.) Do you want to try again?" />
    <string id="0FHc6mU0" text="I meant no offense, madame." />
    <string id="0flB8eqi" text="My husband, I believe that you should rethink you allegiance to {s11}" />
    <string id="0FU95pvn" text="In the end, however, most brides will submit to their parents' choice. A noblewoman's family is everything to her, and few are brave enough to risk its disapproval for the sake of man she barely knows. She may pine for her lover, but still accept the groom -- and without tragic love, what would we have to sing about?" />
    <string id="0g7FoSDH" text="I would prefer not to get mixed up in such things" />
    <string id="0GPdE9vL" text="I have the reports you wanted right here." />
    <string id="0gVNZ8m2" text="Indeed you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about the theory of combat, feel free to ask." />
    <string id="0HAErzhU" text="Of course! Calradian lords make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even though you are a foreigner, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch." />
    <string id="0HXKzSPx" text="I wish for you to retire as minister." />
    <string id="0iPqzXHM" text="Very well, it's all here..." />
    <string id="0JbtwGDn" text="I'm not afraid of you lot. Fight me if you dare!" />
    <string id="0Juq9Sax" text="I assure you, {s65}, I am no friend of {s6}." />
    <string id="0Khnhsb5" text="Very well then. I shall maintain a patrol of this area. Return if you have further orders for me." />
    <string id="0LgJjG3S" text="Let us wait until we are in a hall, my wife, as it is difficult to deal with household inventories and such matters in the field." />
    <string id="0LqPLe9b" text="We need to separate for a while." />
    <string id="0lrftWyb" text="Good. Keep going." />
    <string id="0mlzDHnX" text="Sorry. I don't have time for this right now." />
    <string id="0mOQ966J" text="Uhm. Maybe later." />
    <string id="0nXBNJn8" text="Mere child's play." />
    <string id="0qyd0sbw" text="My lady, if you wish to marry, we can proceed to the feast at {s4} to exchange vows before the lords of the realm." />
    <string id="0RjJBOjb" text="Never mind me. I was just passing by." />
    <string id="0uJLpB3J" text="One time-tested mode of courtship is simply to recite a popular poem, and discuss it. This way, you are both on an equal footing, and neither will have an advantage in knowledge or experience. Of course, different ladies will have different tastes in poetry." />
    <string id="0vwN8bf3" text="What brings you here today?" />
    <string id="0vZqXUjv" text="What is it?" />
    <string id="0wgO41TC" text="Your next opponent will be a {s9}. You need to win {reg8} more fights in a row to advance to the next stage. Are you ready?" />
    <string id="0WotJcYk" text="What is {s10}'s policy in regards to the other realms of Calradia?" />
    <string id="0XtyWaTX" text="Very soon. We're almost there." />
    <string id="0Z0CDeHw" text="Where do the slaves come from?" />
    <string id="0Zwgzo2q" text="That is all for now." />
    <string id="10dVzeen" text="{s61}" />
    <string id="16Aaw5Go" text="Yes, and hopefully now {s4} will think twice before entrusting him with any additional fiefs, honors, or offices. We are grateful to you." />
    <string id="199DyEI3" text="I have" />
    <string id="19SgCwGI" text="Hrm. As you like, {s65}." />
    <string id="1aCNNYdk" text="We've made it this far... Is everything clear up ahead?" />
    <string id="1AoXICh0" text="I do not trust you, and I do not need your support." />
    <string id="1azTbwiZ" text="Then you'd better hurry. We'll be moving out soon against the enemy and I need every able hand we can muster." />
    <string id="1C5J53ra" text="Actually, I can move on to practice." />
    <string id="1CtIz9fv" text="I am looking for some equipment. Show me what you have." />
    <string id="1dS8yuCa" text="Let's go over the accounts." />
    <string id="1e2fmGAd" text="You are a brave soul indeed. I won't forget this." />
    <string id="1GBkywKE" text="There's a group of bandits infesting the town, and I'm at the end of my rope as to how to deal with them. They've been ambushing and robbing townspeople under the cover of night, and then fading away quick as lightning when the guards finally show up. We've not been able to catch a one of them. They only attack lone people, never daring to show themselves when there's a group about. I need someone who can take on these bandits alone and win. That seems to be the only way of bringing them to justice. Are you up to the task?" />
    <string id="1gloIDTj" text="You make a good scout, {PLAYER.LINK}. My runner just brought me your reports of the mission to {s13}, {s14} and {s15}. Well done." />
    <string id="1h0anoB1" text="All right I will join you." />
    <string id="1IhmSNIN" text="Very good. Do you, {PLAYER.LINK}, swear similarly to accept {s4} as your wife?" />
    <string id="1m7FWY1u" text="Eh. We've made it this far... What do you want us to do?" />
    <string id="1nHTaf1B" text="According to my accounts, you owe the merchants guild {reg1}{GOLD_ICON}. I'd better collect that now." />
    <string id="1Nj7pXTg" text="A pleasure doing business with you." />
    <string id="1OzNUy2W" text="I have done enough planning. Time to act!" />
    <string id="1pXa3Fe2" text="Bah, this proved to be a waste of my time." />
    <string id="1Q1nyanY" text="Very good. Whom will you appoint in my stead?" />
    <string id="1q7DbaiM" text="How do you feel about the way things are going in this company?" />
    <string id="1Qeozd3R" text="You will be ransomed and your soldiers will live. I give you my word." />
    <string id="1Rdeqn9S" text="{PLAYER.LINK} -- I am in your debt for bringing back my friend's daughter.  Please take these {reg8}{GOLD_ICON} that I promised you.  My friend wished he could give more but paying that ransom brought him to his knees." />
    <string id="1TPGeDbU" text="You don't have a chance against me. Give up." />
    <string id="1XBWDTaq" text="Ask me again when we are outside of these walls, my wife." />
    <string id="1xRA3FSL" text="Hmm. I'll give it some thought." />
    <string id="1xztn4av" text="Nothing. Forget it." />
    <string id="22jhgOwm" text="Would you be interested in holding a fief?" />
    <string id="242beHq3" text="Very well -- repeat after me:^  The wind that blows the dry steppe dust^  Stirs the curtains in your tower^  The moon that lights my drunken path home^  Looks on you sleeping in your bower^  If I cried out to the wind^  Could it carry a message from my lips?^  If I wept before the moon^  Would it grant me just a glimpse?" />
    <string id="256Br5ot" text="Yes, do that" />
    <string id="26sEkUKu" text="By God, are you serious? What is your plan?" />
    <string id="28U5T3lm" text="Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back." />
    <string id="2aapjlUO" text="Close enough. I like to call myself the man who keeps every boat on this ocean moving. Boats are driven by oars, you see, and oars need men to pull them or they stop. That's where I come in." />
    <string id="2Awnxc4t" text="There is a toll for free passage here!" />
    <string id="2csiq3wZ" text="Never. It is our duty to protect these goods. You shall have to fight us, brigand!" />
    <string id="2g2FhKb5" text="Farewell." />
    <string id="2ImIkrnf" text="I am sorry. I need to attend my own business at the moment." />
    <string id="2inBtb9E" text="Well -- it sounds like you were able to track down the bandits, and show them what happens to those who would disrupt the flow of commerce. Here is your reward: {reg5}{GOLD_ICON}. It is well earned, and we are most grateful." />
    <string id="2p53nflO" text="Damn you! May you burn in Hell!" />
    <string id="2Pl2aUww" text="It is our custom to seal any such alliances with marriage. Unfortunately, no one in my household is eligible to wed." />
    <string id="2QmzKnTW" text="Sorry, lad -- I'm not going to make my {s11} marry you, when I'd rather see her married to {s12}" />
    <string id="2SalBp7H" text="Hm. I'm disappointed, {PLAYER.LINK}. Very disappointed. We'll talk later, I need to go and find somebody to scout for us." />
    <string id="2SLVVWL0" text="My apologies - you must have misunderstood me. Of course you may leave." />
    <string id="2soXRcrp" text="Greetings, stranger." />
    <string id="2vXF5knv" text="Very well. I will indulge your curiosity. But listen closely, because I do not wish to speak of this matter again." />
    <string id="2x6yBsri" text="I want to enter the hall and speak to the lord." />
    <string id="2XFLhFfX" text="Very well. I shall hunt for bandits." />
    <string id="2yrR7mPJ" text="{s8}" />
    <string id="2ZhEriLa" text="I have written a fake letter to {s15}, bearing my own seal, which implicates him in a conspiracy with us to stage a coup in {s14}, in my favour. If we can make {s13} believe the letter is genuine, he will deal with {s15} very swiftly. Of course, the challenge there is to convince {s13} that the letter is indeed real..." />
    <string id="30GZXyim" text="Blast and damn you! I wanted TWO prisoners, {PLAYER.LINK} -- what you've brought me is one step short of useless! I already know everything the spy knows, it was the handler I was after. Here, half a job gets you half a reward. Take it and begone." />
    <string id="33ERt9Za" text="Nothing. We'll leave you in peace." />
    <string id="33HQtbAM" text="Oh, well, I suppose it's possible that I found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing stranger a false impression of life in old {s4}... Well, I guess you can't really know if my word is good, but I reckon you've learned by now that my money is good, and there's another 100{GOLD_ICON}, or maybe a bit more, that's waiting for you if you'll do me this last little favor. So what do you say?" />
    <string id="391eg0y2" text="I'll wipe that smirk right off your face!" />
    <string id="39CIZOSr" text="Well, I have something to tell you." />
    <string id="3as11UpN" text="I am sorry. Let's try once again." />
    <string id="3b0FCE7L" text="Splendid work, {PLAYER.LINK}. All the serfs are back, properly cowed, and they're busy preparing for the harvest. You certainly earned your reward. Here, take it, with my compliments." />
    <string id="3EDlBXDb" text="As you wish, my wife." />
    <string id="3FUaKoUQ" text="I'll keep my ears open for other opportunities. You may want to ask again from time to time." />
    <string id="3gd587fo" text="Well, that is your right, if you indeed have no confidence in our family's commitments. Take your money." />
    <string id="3hmwbKsD" text="Yes, that's it." />
    <string id="3iUCYCUC" text="I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He murdered one of my men and has been on the run from his judgment ever since. I can't let him get away with avoiding justice, so I've put a bounty of 300{GOLD_ICON} on his head. Friends of the murdered man reckon that this assassin may have taken refuge with his kinsmen at {s3}. You might be able to hunt him down and give him what he deserves, and claim the bounty for yourself." />
    <string id="3JGiUKkG" text="You won't be demanding anything when you're dead." />
    <string id="3kq04lUb" text="It was an honor to serve you, {s65}." />
    <string id="3LaizlGp" text="I'd like you to keep all goods in the warehouse until I arrive." />
    <string id="3nbuRBJK" text="Forget it." />
    <string id="3NCm1FiR" text="{s12} says that he does not believe that you would honor your obligations as a vassal, and suspects that your offer is just a ploy." />
    <string id="3P45x6dr" text="Oh, really? My dear -- I could never separate a lady from her family like that..." />
    <string id="3pATIk1o" text="Farewell, {PLAYER.LINK}. We will see each other, in the courts and castles of this realm, but we must keep our distance from each other. I will remember these days fondly, nonetheless." />
    <string id="3pSePqmf" text="You disappoint me, {PLAYER.LINK}. There were 3 groups of serfs that I charged you to return. 3. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {PLAYER.LINK}, I'll only pay you for the serfs you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done." />
    <string id="3QigglRv" text="Because {s45} will reward you with lands." />
    <string id="3qsFZXXb" text="Very well. It is always risky to involve yourself in intrigues of this sort, but in this case, I think you will benefit." />
    <string id="3UNxvZdp" text="Very well then. Here's {reg6}{GOLD_ICON}. " />
    <string id="3uqxbhZn" text="Yes, {PLAYER.LINK}? What can I do for you?" />
    <string id="3YBaFjD8" text="Our preparations are not yet ready. We need another {s11}" />
    <string id="40Gsa6XQ" text="What nonsense are you talking about? You want trouble? You got it." />
    <string id="41IK8uN1" text="That's excellent, {PLAYER.LINK}. I will be grateful to you and so will the family of the man he murdered. And of course the bounty on his head will be yours if you can get him. Well, good hunting to you." />
    <string id="44vtBZWD" text="Do I indeed! There's a group of bandits infesting the town, and I'm at the end of my rope as to how to deal with them. They've been ambushing and robbing townspeople under the cover of night, and then fading away quick as lightning when the guards finally show up. We've not been able to catch a one of them. They only attack lone people, never daring to show themselves when there's a group about. I need someone who can take on these bandits alone and win. That seems to be the only way of bringing them to justice. Are you up to the task?" />
    <string id="45eE0HOd" text="Dear {PLAYER.LINK}, you are kind to ask, but you know little of my troubles and I can't possibly ask you to throw yourself into danger on my behalf." />
    <string id="4aBhgRfb" text="On second thought, no. I don't wish to be in your service again." />
    <string id="4BaB6Iml" text="So here's my proposition. You look like you've had a bit of experience with a blade -- and more importantly, you must have a bit of fire in your belly, or you wouldn't be coming to Calradia to seek your fortune. So here's what I'm asking you to do: gather a small party, track down these bandits to their lair, teach them a lesson they won't forget, and get my brother back safe. In return, you'll earn my lasting gratitude and a bit of silver. What do you say?" />
    <string id="4bJOiFuX" text="No, {s65}. I cannot serve you right now." />
    <string id="4BMZ9nqj" text="Ah {PLAYER.LINK} - you must have received my message. How happy I am that you could come!" />
    <string id="4brk5S8U" text="Do you have any connections that we could use to our advantage?" />
    <string id="4BWKk85h" text="Tell me about your journey" />
    <string id="4CQs0UCj" text="What's it? You have given us the money. We have no more business." />
    <string id="4DNamOKQ" text="Then drop your sword. If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear. We'll go now and talk to your neighbours, and if they verify your story, I'll go on my way." />
    <string id="4fAH0aAG" text="Killing bandits? Why, certainly!" />
    <string id="4gKPSs9e" text="Ah, {PLAYER.LINK}. How good it is to see you again. However, I believe that I am required elsewhere." />
    <string id="4hdUVXhh" text="Surrender! Your situation is hopeless!" />
    <string id="4hNArhst" text="{s12} says that you are already pledged to another ruler." />
    <string id="4i88rUhN" text="You can go in after leaving your weapons with me. No one is allowed to carry arms into the lord's hall." />
    <string id="4kQHaxCA" text="As marshal, I wish you to send a message to the vassals of the realm" />
    <string id="4KSGrUUM" text="You want me to shed my blood outside a fortress while others stand by and watch? I think not." />
    <string id="4LuiyPVS" text="Very well -- repeat after me:^   You are the first and the last^   the outer and the inner^   When I drink from the cup of love^   I escape the tread of time^   A moment in solitude with you^   Would have no beginning and no end" />
    <string id="4m0ZP6X5" text="You fool! Stop playing games and give us the money! " />
    <string id="4MGIQ0aD" text="{s6}" />
    <string id="4Pjxuw1V" text="Oh {PLAYER.LINK}, how happy that would make me! Go ask my {s11} {s4} for permission!" />
    <string id="4QRHOaof" text="Never mind -- there is no fief I can offer." />
    <string id="4vwnpFR4" text="I wish to know more about someone..." />
    <string id="4waEZ9oF" text="It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button]." />
    <string id="4XdfoRPv" text="Thank you for answering the summons, {PLAYER.LINK}. However, as we are now at peace, we do not need your services. You may attend to your other business." />
    <string id="52fnCHvs" text="You already operate a {s4} here. There probably aren't enough skilled tradesmen to start a second enterprise." />
    <string id="5cYz3DGE" text="Most of the great families of this land have a claim to the throne... Given the recent issues with the succession, I should be as legitimate a king as {s4}. " />
    <string id="5Dgu055P" text="Love is as a rose, my lady. Left unplucked, it may wither." />
    <string id="5E31YvJf" text="Excuse me -- please accept my apologies" />
    <string id="5fLBmXbY" text="Of course, my lady" />
    <string id="5FlxQZZi" text="Well, with that you have recevied the basic skills to use all three types of ranged weapons. The rest will come with practice. Train each and every day, and in time you will be as good as the best marksmen in Calradia." />
    <string id="5G40CTzh" text="Lead your men out of the town. I shall catch up with you on the road." />
    <string id="5GAnlDLq" text="Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defense live to tell of it." />
    <string id="5hjazV8i" text="That is most gracious of you, but I do not seek the honor, and I decline your support." />
    <string id="5I9TjmY5" text="All right then. I shall dispatch messengers informing the lords of the realm of your feast at {s4}." />
    <string id="5Iath7cj" text="Oh, it will just have to do." />
    <string id="5Iewdy3J" text="I like that idea." />
    <string id="5LQJ1ypr" text="Or what? Do you intend to duel over a lady? I'll let you know -- our liege frowns on this sort of hot-headed challenge, when every man must stand together against the foreign foe." />
    <string id="5MIkvJAM" text="Be warned, knave! This caravan is under the protection of {s9}. Step out of our way or you will face his fury!" />
    <string id="5O6IbYGn" text="I intend to claim it for myself." />
    <string id="5Ou1Fjza" text="{?NPC.GENDER}Madame{?}Sir{\?}, I made sure he will not act against you." />
    <string id="5qoYjNVs" text="What else do you want to talk, my friend?" />
    <string id="5ruyFvzu" text="Very well then. Under those terms, I offer you my surrender." />
    <string id="5SbabKvP" text="Who are these warmongers who block the way of peace?" />
    <string id="5SodWkYS" text="Very well - {s2} shall receive {s1}." />
    <string id="5tqfIzwZ" text="If you have the opportunity, you may attempt to pay the lady a compliment. This indicates to her that you are a potential suitor, and she will usually know if she wishes you to continue your suit. Incidentally, if you come to her fresh from having distinguished yourself in the tournament or in the hunt, then you may make a stronger first impression than otherwise." />
    <string id="5TsOnpW9" text="As you wish it, {s65}, it shall be done." />
    <string id="5xCL1XB3" text="I'll need you to grab a weapon and help me, despite your weakness." />
    <string id="5ZleWUbP" text="Thank you for escorting me here, {PLAYER.LINK}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude. I hope we shall meet again sometime in the future." />
    <string id="601DmoS3" text="How do I take somebody as prisoner?" />
    <string id="61pkEUO6" text="Did you have any other questions?" />
    <string id="62Swreyg" text="Oh, it's you. Enlighten me, how exactly does one lose a simple fight to some poxy, lowborn merchant? Truly, if I ever need my guardsmen to take a lesson in how to lay down and die, I'll be sure to come to you. Just leave me be, {PLAYER.LINK}, I have things to do." />
    <string id="68RRwc05" text="I was thinking that perhaps we could host a feast" />
    <string id="69X8QbBL" text="Lieges and vassals still watch each other carefully. If a king believes that his vassal is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the vassal for treason and seize his properties. Likewise, if a vassal fears that he will be indicted, he may rebel. Usually, whoever makes the first move will be able to control the vassal's fortresses." />
    <string id="6BepfADB" text="I've come to get you out of here" />
    <string id="6cehZIdT" text="I've some trusted men in my band who could be of use to you. What do you wish to do with them?" />
    <string id="6cupscqe" text="Keep doing what you were doing. I'll catch up with you later." />
    <string id="6DiPiTzi" text="Well, I could use some good soldiers. Thank you." />
    <string id="6g9G7qnb" text="I have nothing against you man. But {s2} wants you dead. Sorry." />
    <string id="6iZTllgY" text="We will fight you to the last drop of blood!" />
    <string id="6Lbg4FQ5" text="I see no particular reason to abandon {s9}, but I will heed your advice. What do you suggest we do?" />
    <string id="6lcnmnKa" text="We are coming from {s11} and heading to {s12}.{s14}" />
    <string id="6PaicCIo" text="I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment." />
    <string id="6r35bebb" text="Actually I want to do something else." />
    <string id="6raLugXo" text="Here, take my arms. I'll go in." />

    <string id="6UtIncZY" text="I'm sorry, but I don't see your point. I am leaving whether you like it or not." />

    <string id="7fwDkKvU" text="Our army sits, doing nothing. Apparently, too few vassals have answered the call to arms. Perhaps {s4} does not enjoy the confidence of the great lords of this realm." />
    <string id="7G9uL9Aj" text="I thought as much. Now, remove yourself from here" />
    <string id="7JU1P9lk" text="Why should I support {s44}?" />
    <string id="7kc3BHDz" text="My lady, I would like to dedicate my successes in this recent tournament to you" />
    <string id="7kuFaqzN" text="However, we can't organize this like one of those nice arena bouts, where everyone places their bets beforehand. People will walk in, drawn by the noise, and put a denar or two on whichever one of your two they think is winning. I'll give 'em even odds -- anything else is going to be too tricky for someone who's already on his third flagon of ale." />

    <string id="7lslkFJx" text="I like your spirit! Go and bring me one of our enemies, and I'll toast your name in my hall when you return! And reward you for your efforts, of course..." />
    <string id="7mnbJz6L" text="Well, it's not as simple as all that. Blunt weapons don't do as much damage as sharp ones, so they won't bring your enemies down as quickly. And trust me, given the chance, most of the scum you run across would just as soon kill you as look at you, so don't expect any courtesy when you pull out a club instead of a sword. Moreover, having to drag prisoners to and fro will slow down your party, which is why some people simply set their prisoners free after the fighting's done. It's madness. How could anyone turn down all that silver, eh?" />
    <string id="7N5jjxsd" text="That seems reasonable. I am willing to do this." />

    <string id="7YulaGYF" text="Oh {PLAYER.LINK} -- I heard of your duel with {s10}. I wish now that you had never fought him, for our honor and tradition demand that, having lost to him, you now break off your suit with me. Farewell, {PLAYER.LINK}." />

    <string id="838PYfbv" text="That would hardly be proper. It would be more appropriate for you to follow me instead. Did you have any other ideas?" />
    <string id="84PKpG0v" text="Now -- go find and defeat that group of bandits." />
    <string id="89WzjsWG" text="Lady -- I will speak bluntly. Most of the lords of this land are looking for a demure maiden, whose skin as fair as snow -- and your skin is burnt brown by the sun. They want a maiden whose voice is soft as bells -- and your voice is hoarse from commanding men in battle. Also, athough the lords of Calradia appreciate poems about love, most also want heirs, and few women can ride and fight while with child." />
    <string id="8BaW4Nxb" text="I come not for money, but to execute the law!" />
    <string id="8dfVT0U7" text="I have a sensitive matter which needs tending to, {PLAYER.LINK}, and no trustworthy retainers to take care of it. The fact is that I have a spy in {s13} to keep an eye on things for me, and report anything that might warrant my attention. Every week I send someone to collect the spy's reports and bring them back to me. The job's yours if you wish it." />
    <string id="8FtUjljK" text="Good {PLAYER.LINK} -- to elope would be to throw away my ties with my family, which are everything to me! I have a considerable affection for you, but I am not sure that I am prepared to risk that." />

    <string id="8lMc1jzb" text="Nothing. Sorry to trouble you." />
    <string id="8PsNsmuO" text="I must refuse, {s65}. I am not a kidnapper." />
    <string id="8Qg6z7n5" text="Yes. I have already made my position on this matter clear. I believe that {s4} should be marshal instead of {s5}." />
    <string id="8swa6RC5" text="So, what do you think?" />
    <string id="8vZtUova" text="Good. You didn't have too much difficulty using the crossbow either. Next you will learn to use throwing weapons. Pick up the javelins you see over there and try to hit those three targets. " />
    <string id="8YseboQc" text="No problem. I really just need your head, anyway." />
    <string id="8Z3d1LSL" text="As you like, {s65}. I will accept your judgment." />
    <string id="8zFKJAEl" text="I knew it! Come on, lads, lets go get these bastards! Thanks a lot, friend." />
    <string id="94aLJ2k7" text="You came back? Quick, give us the money now." />
    <string id="94DGkz55" text="My lady, with this assembly as my witness, I vow to take you as my wife, to honor, cherish, and protect you. My the heavens bless us with health, prosperity, and children." />
    <string id="96VR99TR" text="Perhaps I may be able to help. Whom did you have in mind?" />

    <string id="9bg7q4bI" text="That is a shame, but I would be remiss in my duty if I allowed her ladyship to face an uncertain future." />
    <string id="9bybGj8M" text="Splendid work, {PLAYER.LINK} -- your audacious attack is the talk of the realm. No doubt they, or others like them, will soon be back, but for a short while you have bought this land a small respite. We are most grateful to you." />
    <string id="9cje3b42" text="Why would you say such a thing? To insult me like this, in spite of our friendship -- how much crueler is a knife in my back from an erstwhile friends, than the sword of a sworn foe. I do not know what game you are playing, but I want no part of it. Go away. I do not want to look at you." />
    <string id="9cSjq1CA" text="My lady, my eyes rejoice to see you. We may proceed with the vows." />

    <string id="9HXorMBO" text="Tell me about yourself" />
    <string id="9iXvMMpd" text="Your objection is noted. Now fall back in line." />
    <string id="9JfUq6of" text="Thanks, Ramun. Perhaps I may try my hand at it." />
    <string id="9mBy0qNW" text="I must leave now." />
    <string id="9NjeyP6C" text="My lady, I have grown tired of waiting. Let us proceed with the vows immediately." />

I should point out though, sire, that I am not very skilled in the ways of politics, and that I am anxious to return to private life.

A lover steals into a garden in Veluca, and plies her with lots of witty lines to persuade his lover to submit to his embraces. She shoots down all of his advances one by one, then when he is downcast, she takes him in her arms and tells him that she wanted him all along, except on her terms, not his. A lady with a sense of humor may find it amusing, but others might feel that they are the ones who are being mocked." />

The watch commander tells us it's because of all the fighting on the frontiers -- fewer men to keep an eye on the streets -- but I'm not sure what to make of that. It seems to me that the most logical explanation is that these bandits have an ally inside the walls, who helps them enter unnoticed and helps them identify particularly tempting targets...

Here in {s5}, the villages produce less than the hinterland around {reg4} towns, and produce more than {reg5}. The wealth of a town's hinterland, of course, is heavily dependent on the tides of war.

    <string id="mHPovEYp" text="I am not interested, have more important business to do." />
    <string id="MhwLbIPF" text="I asked you for two prisoners, {PLAYER.LINK}, not one. Two. Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair.

    <string id="mPhbPTwz" text="Excellent! You know what to do, {PLAYER.LINK}, now get to it. I need that cattle sooner rather than later." />
    <string id="mPjKOkTD" text="Elope with you? Yes -- we could do that. It is a great step to defy my family -- but a loveless marriage, and life without you, might be a far worse thing!

Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit." />

    <string id="oKpkMMvM" text="Well, some of the serfs working my fields in {s4} have run away. The ungrateful swine, I let them plough my fields and rent my cottages, and this is how they repay me!

I want you to capture all three groups and fetch them back to {s4} by whatever means necessary.

    <string id="p0LUsBOt" text="For the sake of our friendship, I defer to your judgment. I will try to make amends with {s11}." />
    <string id="p0VfJXwJ" text="That is too great a matter for me to decide, {PLAYER.LINK}. You should seek out {s4}. Such clemency is his alone to grant or deny." />
    <string id="p10bbBzm" text="Well... To be honest, I think that we in the guild would like to know you a little better. We can be very particular about outsiders coming in here and buying land." />
    <string id="P1xS5ng8" text="I prefer my companions not to bother me with such trivialities." />
    <string id="p3Sxj4Sb" text="Very well -- to the walls!" />
    <string id="p4F3rlK1" text="So be it -- I pledge allegiance to you as your faithful vassal. I shall stand at your side to fight your enemies should you need my sword, and uphold your claims and those of your legitimate heirs.

    <string id="P9AC1y0G" text="Yes, yes... Now, a couple of my boys have the watch captain pinned down in a back room, with a knife at his throat. I''ll need to go drag him before {s5} and explain what this breach of the peace is all about. You don't need to be part of that, though. I'll tell you what -- if all goes well, I'll meet you in the tavern again shortly, and let you know how it all came out. If you don't see me in the tavern, but instead see my head on a spike over the city gate, I'll assume you know enough to stay out of town for a while and forget this whole episode ever happened.

    <string id="PsO8ORwg" text="Oh! I can't ask that of you, {PLAYER.LINK}, but... I would be forever indebted to you, and you are so sure. It would mean so much if you would defend my honour. Thank you a thousand times, all my prayers and my favour go with you." />
    <string id="PTBAblLk" text="I want to practice blocking with my weapon." />
    <string id="PtFIbVrK" text="Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous." />
    <string id="PtrJhIpt" text="Now, men do not trust a vassal who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a king who lightly throws around charges of treason.

Now, I will tell you which direction to attack from and you must try to do the correct attack. ^^(Move your mouse while you press the left mouse button to specify attack direction. For example, to execute an overhead attack, move the mouse up at the instant you press the left mouse button. The icons on your screen will help you do the correct action.)" />
    <string id="pWHareXc" text="Now, you can go talk with the melee fighters or the archery trainer if you haven't already done so. You need to learn everything you can to be prepared when you have to defend yourself." />

First, you could station a garrison here to protect the castle from any immediate counterattacks, then request an audience with some wealthy lord and ask him to make you an offer. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege lord and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the castle.

Well, I suppose you were too, but you're a stranger here, and didn't know how bad things have become. He had no such excuse. But he's family, so what can you do? If you don't protect your kin, then people will start thinking that you can't protect your investements, either, and I can't have that...

    <string id="tPKZHnhh" text="Well, there is a very great favor which you could do us... As you may have heard, some {s10}s have come across the border to attack our people. {s5} is under great pressure from some of the more bellicose of his vassals to respond with a declaration of war. Unfortunately, while the great lords of this land grow rich from bloodshed, we of the commons will be caught in the middle, and will suffer." />
    <string id="TPOukxWZ" text="Perhaps another time, then." />
    <string id="TQgnA4Cg" text="Very good! A raid on a caravan, or, if you can't manage that, an attack on one of their villages, should do the trick. Now, good luck and good hunting. Go set the borders aflame!" />

They'll follow you if you pay. So... Take this purse of 100{GOLD_ICON}. Consider it an advance on your reward. Go round to the villages, and use the money to hire some help.

Her father, who pledged her to another, comes with his sons and his huscarls to kill Helgered. They fight, and Helgered and Kara slaughter the entire host except for Kara's beloved younger brother -- who, alas, grows up to avenge his father by slaying Helgered. The depiction of warrior and shieldmaiden as equals will appeal to some women, but a mail-wearing, blood-spattered heroine will shock and repulse others." />

    <string id="Xrl2CPsa" text="I am tired of these games! I will speak to your family about arranging a wedding immediately.." />
    <string id="XSBSU9vI" text="Thank you master." />
    <string id="XSvBIA0L" text="At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers." />
    <string id="XTZxpRla" text="Alright, I'll try and expain it again in simple terms. The basic rule of taking someone prisoner is knocking him down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cutting him open with a sword. That way he goes to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, you see? It's a bit different for nobles and such, they tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon you use, but your average rabble-rouser will bleed like a stuck pig if you get him with something sharp." />
    <string id="xUMBw9bs" text="I am thinking of buying a horse." />
    <string id="XUSDKSJJ" text="You're doing good work. Stay here for a little longer" />
    <string id="xWyZi6Ag" text="So great is my loneliness! How I miss my family!" />
    <string id="xXwFFIYx" text="All right. I will do my best." />
    <string id="xzQzPQ22" text="Are you sure you want to drop that idea?" />
    <string id="Y12FtnqV" text="Aye, I can take the herd to {s13}." />
    <string id="Y2hkCFZV" text="I am afraid, I can't be of much help in that case, {PLAYER.LINK}. I am sorry." />
    <string id="y2lyltxZ" text="Indeed. You may stand by your words, but keep them to yourself. I will not have you undercutting my faithful follower {s4}." />
    <string id="y2TtYuRh" text="Haven't you got any mercy? Ok, we will fight you to the last man!" />
    <string id="y3rgMlYw" text="Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defense buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by maneuvering your horse.]" />
    <string id="Y4jwHrbX" text="I want you to arrest this man immediately!" />
    <string id="Y5iYkqku" text="Perhaps I may still be able to change your {s11}'s mind" />
    <string id="y6DSyJap" text="Underlying all the tensions is the possibility that a lord may abandon his liege, and pledge vassalhood to another. In theory, each lord has sworn an oath of vassalage, but in practice, a vassal can always find an excuse to absolve himself. The vassal may claim that the liege has failed to hold up his end of the bargain, to protect the vassal and treat him justly. Or, the vassal may claim that his liege is in fact a usurper, and another has a better claim to the kingship." />
    <string id="Y6NsnfGl" text="Yes. Here is money for the land." />
    <string id="y9HNHxHy" text="Everything in his power, you say? Em... Let me think about this..." />
    <string id="y9TRGNwz" text="Yes. We no longer need all our forces here." />
    <string id="yARXQlEN" text="You'll not help a woman in need? You should be ashamed, {PLAYER.LINK}... Please leave me, I have some important embroidery to catch up." />
    <string id="yaY6mO9t" text="Tell me what kind of practice you want." />
    <string id="ybLYC8eo" text="Every so often, a king or great lord of Calradia will hold a feast. In towns they will often be accompanied by tournaments, and in castles they will be accompanied by hunts. The feasts provide a chance for the lords to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests." />
    <string id="yc0McwdT" text="Maybe I can help you. Who are you looking for?" />
    <string id="Yd2ATzbQ" text="Oh, yes, of course. We had already got the money for you. Here, please accept these {reg12}{GOLD_ICON} together with our most sincere thanks. Me and the people of our town will not forget your help." />
    <string id="yD3bFyqa" text="Truly, {PLAYER.LINK}, you are nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy AND his handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I offered you. You've done nothing to earn it." />
    <string id="YDbO3Nyk" text="Haven't you already taken up the cause of {s17}? You must have a very strong sense of justice, indeed. But no, thank you. I will not be part of your game." />
    <string id="YDCbrW2z" text="Well, that's all I can tell you. Good bye." />
    <string id="ydyscteN" text="Do you want us to follow you?" />
    <string id="YEDo05Vv" text="You have no chance against us. Surrender now or we will kill you all..." />
    <string id="yFcagxBb" text="At this point, there are no particularly urgent matters which need your attention. Is there anything you wish done?" />
    <string id="YfdMi33Q" text="Excellent! You'll find the looters roaming around the countryside, probably trying to rob more good people. Kill or capture the bastards, I don't care what you do with them. I'll pay you a bounty of 40{GOLD_ICON} on every band of looters you destroy, until all the looters are dealt with." />
    <string id="YfGPPc4S" text="The amount the bandits ask as ransom is {reg12}{GOLD_ICON}. I will give you that money once you accept to take the quest. You have 15 days to take the money to the bandits who will be waiting near the village of {s4}. Those bastards said that they are going to kill the poor girl if they don't get the money by that time. You will get your pay of {reg8}{GOLD_ICON} when you bring the girl safely back here." />
    <string id="Yg5xaUa4" text="Perhaps... Do you give your word of honour that we'll be treated well?" />
    <string id="ykhSfUuM" text="Yes. Come with me. I'll take you home." />
    <string id="ylPQg8Ib" text="There is a small thing... My {s17} {s13} is due for a visit to her relatives at {s14}. The visit has been postponed several times already with all the trouble on the roads, but this time she is adamant about going. So, I want to at least make sure she's well-guarded. I trust you well, {PLAYER.LINK} so I would be very grateful if you could escort her to {s14} and make sure she arrives safe and sound." />
    <string id="ymfQWF8Q" text="You have already been well-rewarded with fiefs appropriate to your accomplishments, I would say." />
    <string id="YmoacLba" text="{s14}" />
    <string id="yn3Kuj7f" text="I stand by my words, my liege." />
    <string id="YNeH1IaD" text="It is not unheard-of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to a Calradian king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name. This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long ancestries, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their monarch. Such rulers would need to be very careful in establishing their right to rule, or they would be set upon from all sides." />
    <string id="ypAKY9ap" text="{s1} is not being managed by anyone. Whom shall I put in charge?" />
    <string id="ypKzY3pI" text="Oh really? Well, I'm not just going to wait around here. I'm going to go to the towns to look for other work. Is that what you want?" />
    <string id="YQA8wyM6" text="Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button]." />
    <string id="yr3f3kEJ" text="I am {PLAYER.LINK}." />
    <string id="Yrp43Z2b" text="Hah! Those prisoners are only going free if you pay their ransom. Did you bring any silver?" />
    <string id="yrW9RGEl" text="It is a sad day when that {s43} manages to avoid the hand of justice yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {PLAYER.LINK}. Clearly I was wrong." />
    <string id="ysiagNDd" text="I am interested." />
    <string id="ysxUzdCR" text="I have changed my mind. You must back to your village!" />
    <string id="YtB8JGys" text="Well, {s21}, at last I've found you. I have returned from my mission to {s31}. In general, I would say, {s14}." />
    <string id="YunhrsJs" text="I am the rightful queen of Calradia" />
    <string id="YUoK41eu" text="Ah, {PLAYER.LINK}. Have you any progress to report?" />

    <string id="yUPOktil" text="I am not afraid of you, I will fight." />
    <string id="yUTtDmxz" text="Let's begin then. I am ready." />
    <string id="yVmNMjEp" text="Worry not, I can go to {s15} and deal with these scum for you." />
    <string id="YvmoEc8v" text="Hey, I am trying to practice here. Go, talk with the archery trainer if you need guidance about ranged weapons." />
    <string id="YvsrkSha" text="Aye, I am ready." />
    <string id="YVVZjsi8" text="Forgive me, you look like a trader, but I see none of your merchandise." />
    <string id="YvYajbVu" text="Splendid idea -- you do that." />
    <string id="YXiJgTig" text="Very good. {s9} is your new minister. I shall make ready to rejoin you." />
    <string id="YXpCqxM0" text="Very well -- repeat after me:^All the silks of Veluca, all the furs of Khudan^Would buy you not the briefest kiss^What I bestow, I bestow for love^And the sake of my own happiness^But brought you a gift? Let us see! Let us see!^Or should tell my father how you came to see me?" />
    <string id="yYRwWF0a" text="Very well - we must do as tradition demands... Farewell, my lady" />
    <string id="yZDHMlUV" text="I wish you to rejoin my party." />
    <string id="YZENPWr3" text="Wait here a while longer. I'll come back for you." />
    <string id="yzo2wTya" text="That I wish to put myself under his protection, as his vassal." />
    <string id="YZVpoe9W" text="Well, nothing new lately. Prices, weather, the war, the same old things." />
    <string id="Yzw5bKla" text="Well... My brother is home safe. I'm not sure what to do with him -- maybe pack him off to a university outside Calradia. That way, if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl, no one can say it's my fault. But that's not your problem. Here's the rest of your reward. It was well-earned." />
    <string id="Z0x0XCGv" text="You are the first and the last/the outer and the inner..." />
    <string id="z10YRevP" text="A {s8} it is." />
    <string id="Z2ky9Ms7" text="No, that's not it. There's another issue I wish to discuss." />
    <string id="Z4biEQTD" text="What?! What infamy is this?" />
    <string id="z4CPS1If" text="Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]" />
    <string id="z5bh5UKG" text="Alright. I will make the delivery." />
    <string id="z6pMCwaf" text="{s66}, you should have {s1} for yourself. (fiefs: {s0})" />
    <string id="Z6sDmM8b" text="On second thought, it will be better to stay together for now." />
    <string id="Z7To1Tun" text="Let's abandon our plan to {s10}." />
    <string id="za78F8gO" text="Don't attack! We surrender." />
    <string id="zAkghqEv" text="Which fief did you have in mind?" />
    <string id="ZaVwisKq" text="Nothing. Forget it" />
    <string id="zBckiq0Y" text="Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well." />
    <string id="ZbgpZgAn" text="{PLAYER.LINK}, I've been expecting you. Word has reached my ears of your exploits. Why, I keep hearing such tales of prowess and bravery that my mind was quickly made up. I knew that I had found someone worthy of becoming my vassal." />
    <string id="zCckB8yK" text="I hope you don't fail. In that case, I'll have to ask for the price of the cargo you were carrying." />
    <string id="zDbCHabg" text="Thank you, good {?PLAYER.GENDER}lady{?}sire{\?}. I never forget someone who's done me a good turn." />
    <string id="ZEDYzpl0" text="I had discussed this idea with some of my men. One could enter {s24}, either in disguise or openly, then walk up to the prison guard and try to take the keys by force. However, getting out may be difficult. The garrison may be slow to react, but even so, you are likely to find yourself fighting a half dozen or more of the enemy at once, with limited space in which to maneuver. If you can fight your way past them, though, you can probably get out." />

    <string id="zoGULftr" text="Do you mean that? {s11} will be honor-bound to fight you, but challenging a lord to duel over a woman is seen as a bit hot-headed, even in this warlike age." />

    <string id="zpioxFi7" text="All right. I will do that.{s12}" />

    <string id="zRkrtG1h" text="As a consequence, it seems, our captain turned to villainy to recoup his fortune. I supposed I'd do the same if, the Heavens forbid, I ever faced indebtedness and ruination. Now, any watch captain worth his salary will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll, to inform on the rest, but our captain decides to employ these bastards wholesale. He brings them into the town, lets them do as they will, and takes a share of their take. You've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers? Well, in the unfortunate land of Calradia, sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher. Luckily, there's are still a few brave, honest souls in the watch who've told me how he works." />
