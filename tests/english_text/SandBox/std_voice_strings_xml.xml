    <string id="03Q47XnC" text="Well now. I always like to know a bit about people before I kill them. Do you care to tell me your good name?" />
    <string id="1BZmK6EP" text="Well, now... Guess we'll be spilling each other's blood shortly. Anything on your mind, before we set to it?" />
    <string id="2V0eF42T" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... So good to see you. It's been too long." />
    <string id="3bW5jWJ1" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... However much one may show oneself unworthy of trust, one should always have another chance to make amends. In this spirit, I shall listen to whatever you have to say." />
    <string id="3WtZ4AKa" text="I don't know you... If you have anything to say, say it quickly. The ravens are hungry and I would not keep them waiting." />
    <string id="43KLZl7D" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... If it comes down to a fight between you and me, well... I'll take no joy in it." />
    <string id="4Lfz6ux4" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... It's been a while.." />
    <string id="4RbOYBQb" text="Halt. You want to tell me who you are, or shall we just have at it?" />
    <string id="4RMGcBuj" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Peace to you... I am glad to see you." />
    <string id="5C1seeEM" text="Halt! Do you have anything to say, before I give the order to attack?" />
    <string id="5RpfV389" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... My sword is yours to command." />
    <string id="7dqD89gR" text="Stop there. You can tell me who you are, or save your breath for what comes next." />
    <string id="7eDCl1nd" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I've got you. You're not going anywhere." />
    <string id="8i2Z7jJa" text="Halt there. So, tell me who I fight?" />
    <string id="8kCCsahd" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I know your tricks, and you know mine. So, fight or parley, let's just get to it..." />
    <string id="97bAooa5" text="God.. Wine here tastes like piss. Right... So who're you?" />
    <string id="9emUaMsx" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I'm at your service." />
    <string id="9MZ1SaXt" text="Well... I don't believe we've met. Would you care to tell me your good name?" />
    <string id="A3eeOUZH" text="You know what I think of you. This better be important." />
    <string id="a67lBQad" text="Who are you? Answer quickly, before I give the order to attack." />
    <string id="AoBIFXZH" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Well, well. I am most curious to hear whatever it is you have to say." />
    <string id="aOkilS3H" text="Right. So who might you be, then?" />
    <string id="axO6JCWt" text="If you please... Stop there. I would ask you for your name." />
    <string id="ay0tHozl" text="Aye? So who're you, then?" />
    <string id="AYeRBAxA" text="Now then. Come no closer. Forgive me, but one cannot be too cautious. I would ask you for your name." />
    <string id="B05S6Fw4" text="Who are you, and what do you want?" />
    <string id="b9DEXqta" text="Halt there. Right... So we can parley a bit. But try anything tricky, my boys will cut you down." />
    <string id="bI4IbX25" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Well... Been a while since I last laid eyes on you. Can't say I minded much." />
    <string id="BXpMYumQ" text="Well... Forgive me if I cannot wish you 'peace,' old friend. Fate does what it will." />
    <string id="CcPZbyiv" text="Stop there, mate. So, you might want to tell me your name, before we cross swords." />
    <string id="CdHlFmue" text="Tell me your name. Forgive me if I have met you before and do not remember the occasion, for I have seen many warriors come to this land and pass swiftly into shallow graves." />
    <string id="CEKlT71P" text="Well. Here we are. Give me a decent funeral if I fall to your sword, and I'll do the same for you. Do you have anything to say?" />
    <string id="CiquaIVy" text="It looks like your sins have yet to catch up with you. But they will, believe me they will.." />
    <string id="cXQm4Wba" text="Halt... If you respect the terms of the parley, I will listen." />
    <string id="d6LHL0Fj" text="Looks like you're caught, and I'm glad I'm the one who caught you." />
    <string id="DwqTbXhg" text="Well... Unless I reckon the odds falsely, I'd say you have a very good chance of feasting with your ancestors before this day is through." />
    <string id="DXYVZbcz" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Ready to give me a good fight?" />
    <string id="F1KEe2XG" text="Please be brief. I am pressed for time." />
    <string id="fQRGVkTL" text="Well, if it comes down to you and me, let's make it a fight that the bards will sing about, hey?" />
    <string id="G0qCtfK2" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Such a pity we meet like this." />
    <string id="g9Gav4yj" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... So... A serpent has come to hiss in my ear." />
    <string id="GCTtfyGS" text="I don't know what we have to say to each other." />
    <string id="GgERkyDL" text="My lady..." />
    <string id="gGjqzb5j" text="What is it, stranger? Who're you?" />
    <string id="gLWgcDUN" text="Ah, the gods are kind. What kind of death do you want, dog?" />
    <string id="gMyAYyEX" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... It's been a while." />
    <string id="h6g4OQqT" text="Halt right there. Now then... Tell me your name, before we cross swords." />
    <string id="hAbpAkIw" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I think your luck has run out." />
    <string id="hbvuSLB0" text="Well. Here we are. I once thought friendship was sacred, but all sacred things are profaned in the end. Don't think I won't kill you if I need to." />
    <string id="iNYLG9P1" text="I am very angry with you. Too much time has gone by since last you visited." />
    <string id="IU3KjVbT" text="That's close enough. Who are you?" />
    <string id="j6p0K0s6" text="{STR_SALUTATION}. I'm yours to command." />
    <string id="jljaKTRo" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I am a bit pressed for time right now. What is it?" />
    <string id="k8gI5Ix3" text="Your pardon - I did not catch your name." />
    <string id="KJsVOyUE" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Such a delight to see you." />
    <string id="KnJoVOEk" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I'm at your command." />
    <string id="Kp0Mc35d" text="Halt. Who're you?" />
    <string id="l03Kxell" text="Halt... Before we fight, I would know your name." />
    <string id="l0Bmbgqg" text="Come no closer. Before we come to blows, I would ask you your name." />
    <string id="laroTh3e" text="Do you have anything to say, before I give the order to attack?" />
    <string id="lbH0Fw9s" text="I've waited a long time for this day. Have a good look around you, for soon your eyes will have little to see but the inside of a raven's belly." />
    <string id="lK32NXY8" text="I trust you have been keeping well, doing honor to your name and cutting bloody swathes through your enemies." />
    <string id="LNhUaIoB" text="Right, you. Prepare to get what's coming to you." />
    <string id="LRpsEe3F" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Good to see you." />
    <string id="lvScVM9T" text="Please be brief. I am pressed for time." />
    <string id="M5HVzG5S" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Been a while." />
    <string id="mcNlccCF" text="Aye? I don't think I know you. Peace to you, stranger." />
    <string id="mHjnRrLk" text="Well, I'll not deny it. It'll be a real pleasure to watch you writhing and bleeding in the dust." />
    <string id="mkFfE4Pm" text="That's close enough, now. Who are you?" />
    <string id="n5Va4JVo" text="Ah, good. Justice seems to have appointed me her executioner today. Are you partial to the sword, or the noose?" />
    <string id="nESnaBbx" text="My lady... You are lovely as ever." />
    <string id="nOMhLR63" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... You are lovely as ever." />
    <string id="Ny7o14yZ" text="Tell me your name. I always prefer to know whom I slay." />
    <string id="NZ9E0KVb" text="You know I don't care for you. What's it you want to say?" />
    <string id="nzSUfX5b" text="Prepare to reap a villain's reward, villain!" />
    <string id="oqSF8Ueu" text="Well now, stranger. Peace to you. What is your name?" />
    <string id="oYskGouF" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... My heart is glad to see you." />
    <string id="p1CHHIFb" text="Forgive me for what may seem an abundance of caution, but please keep your distance. Just beyond sword-length is fine. So, who might you be?" />
    <string id="PCLD3G3s" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I'd wish you peace and prosperity, but of course I don't want that." />
    <string id="pf3LDFVp" text="Leave your sword in its scabbard for a moment longer, stranger. Who might you be?" />
    <string id="PiaaXapn" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... It's very good to see you." />
    <string id="PihQGbui" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I take no joy in fighting you, but believe me I will do it if I need to." />
    <string id="pm786w3d" text="Such a pleasant surprise to see you. I hope my men can find some fetters of silver or gold, worthy of your rank, as it appears you may be gracing us with your presence tonight." />
    <string id="PvxtpJaY" text="Yours is not a face I know. What is your name, stranger?" />
    <string id="Q3kWez4P" text="Stop there. Who are you? It is better we know each other's names, even if we fight." />
    <string id="q3WvWFD1" text="{STR_SALUTATION}. It's been a while." />
    <string id="qSVbfakb" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Such a delight to see you." />
    <string id="RNfnK0Vv" text="Em.... Greetings, my lady. I do not believe that we've met." />
    <string id="rWuWrr2s" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I won't pretend I like you, but I'll hear you out." />
    <string id="s27yxVHY" text="Do you have anything to say?" />
    <string id="SCGyic5H" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Try my patience, and you'll regret it." />
    <string id="SdXCOffd" text="Respect the terms of the parley, and I will do likewise. Now, who are you?" />
    <string id="TCJIGLaL" text="Your health, stranger! So who might you be?" />
    <string id="TjrwrSH9" text="Peace to you, stranger. What is your name?" />
    <string id="tJVlv0TN" text="Since you're not going anywhere, we might as well have a little chat. Perhaps you'd like to introduce yourself?" />
    <string id="TmQpdK7M" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Your beauty is a balm to my troubles." />
    <string id="U2Kr8vTy" text="I've caught you. Don't try any tricks. Anything to say?" />
    <string id="uGuu5JPx" text="{STR_SALUTATION}...You'd best pray someone gives you a quick death in battle one of these days, because if you ever fall into my hands, you'll find I have a long memory, and do not forgive." />
    <string id="uhSeQI7D" text="Say whatever you have to say. After that, you die." />
    <string id="uLkQmlad" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Fate clearly loves to watch old friends fight... Still, don't think I won't do my duty." />
    <string id="uVm44ScK" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Peace to you." />
    <string id="UW9Pexaq" text="{STR_SALUTATION}. I'm yours to command. Allow me to write your will in the pages of history in letters of blood. Or whatever else you may need..." />
    <string id="vvkBHcAL" text="I don't know you. I suppose you should tell me your name." />
    <string id="vyeEx182" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... I don't want to have to fight you. But I will, friend, I will." />
    <string id="WAK8lSaW" text="Well, good day to you. So who might you be?" />
    <string id="wIXmtKa5" text="What a pleasant surprise! I believe I'm going to enjoy this. Do you have anything to say, before I give the order to attack?" />

    <string id="xAaxpdb3" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... It's very, very good to see you." />
    <string id="xiFrtNGH" text="Ah... Fate smiles on me today. I can think of no sweeter music than your death-rattle." />
    <string id="XmwqrCLY" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... You know, puffed-up bandits such as yourself always get what they deserve, in the end." />
    <string id="y41EYSBI" text="{STR_SALUTATION}. It's good to see you." />
    <string id="yd0sShGW" text="Halt there. Who are you? I would know whom I slay." />
    <string id="YGAYp0pO" text="Aye? Sorry, I don't think I know you." />
    <string id="YJvvaeDq" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... You'd best pray to the Heavens for mercy, because I intend to show none to you." />
    <string id="YubrUiab" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... You still live, I see. Pity." />
    <string id="Z2bRJhTh" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... If you die well today, I'll be sure your courage is remembered." />
    <string id="z3zTyNru" text="Come any closer, stranger, and I'll stick a knife in your belly. But if you stay where you are, we may have a pleasant enough chat." />
    <string id="ZBjXh6cA" text="Stop there, stranger. I bid you peace. At least until I find out who you are, anyway." />
    <string id="ZRUCzgxQ" text="{STR_SALUTATION}... Unless you have something worthwhile to say, go pour your poison into someone else's ear." />
